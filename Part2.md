## Getting started
I this workshop we'll use SQLite, a powerful and easy to install database engine. Conveniently, it's built in to the Firefox web browser. If you don't have Firefox installed, please install it now. Once it's installed, you'll need to also install the [SQLite Manager extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/).
